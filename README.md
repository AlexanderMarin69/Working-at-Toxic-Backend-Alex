# Restaurant Decider
 
## Estimation
* 3h to get basic functionality working
* 7h for fully fledged functionality

## How to run
1. Clone / download .zip
2. Restore Packages
3. Run Project 

## Note
As i ran this on mac i did not have access to SSMS, hence the in memory data persistence (FakeDataStore).

## Future Features

1. use of repository, i have created a generic repository but its not implemented.

2. use of guard clauses for instance if list of restaurants is empty - the get attempt should be denied

3. use of database instead of in memory storage

4. add items on the menu as menuItems instead of free text - would enable to filtering down the line

5. The solution setup for the projects e.g. Class Library.

6. An own controller for the restaurant, there sohuld have been a separate restaurant controller...

7. Success message when restaurant has been added
